"So far, so good (and dry)",5,YES,25," November 9, 2016",S. R. Southard,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSZHM2RWGDITBSSIWII5KIL7XNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R3V8GIDXRW18FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I had my first opportunity to use the umbrella today. It worked well, and held up to a stiff wind, too. However, it's probably silly to rate an umbrella after one day's use. They all work on the first day. I suppose the extra (9th) rib helps it stand up to wind, but it also provides an additional point of potential failure as the umbrella ages. I'm used to buying umbrellas at the nearest drug store. They last a few years, then fail, either by leaking or more likely by a broken rib or broken shaft detent. I like umbrellas that collapse into a small package I can fit inside my briefcase. This is the first umbrella I bought on Amazon. As I say, so far, so good. However, I may update this review someday if the umbrella fails earlier than it should have."
Not really a lifetime warranty...,2,YES,On," July 10, 2018",Rico,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHPMHF3SVDZNM4H4TU5LVFPU2TFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R1ZA3BN4C4N2HP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I bought this umbrella a few months ago and unfortunately, it broke while it was windy out. I think ""windproof"" is a bit much because it was pretty windy but the umbrella still broke. I emailed them and they refunded the purchase but never sent a new one. I emailed them about this and got no response so I ordered another and asked for a refund on the purchase and they said this one would have to break before I can get a refund, which just seems convoluted. Overall, the umbrella is nice but worth $20 at most and neither the handle nor circumference is very big. When its windy and rainy, you need something a little bigger or it'll go right around the umbrella and if you're wearing a backpack, you can expect it to be soaked. I would've been happy to have purchased it if their customer service was better about replacing a broken umbrella when asked instead of making me jump through the hoops."

This umbrella is ""The Best of The Best!""for the following reasons:1. The frame is strong.2. The handle is strong.3. The open/close mechanism is easy to operate; reaction is swift: when opening and closing.4. THE FABRIC IS THICK AND REPELS WATER INSTANTLY. Also: The fabric is attached to the frame with strong thread and the stitching is secure.5. The size is perfect to stow in a purse, briefcase, backpack, etc.6. EXCELLENT QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE PRICE.7. The stowage sleeve is convenient and made of the same excellent Teflon fabric."
Most good quality umbrellas can't stand up to winds 20 mph,3,YES,2," April 25, 2018",Linann,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHOQQUOG6JHT6OK5BPAOO7DU2PGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R2EYVBN7DSTD4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I work in New Haven CT, and in the fall, and winter the wind comes right off the water, so I'm always in the market for an umbrella that will last for a couple of years. I learned from experience, that there is no such thing as an umbrella that can stand up to 50 mph. Most good quality umbrellas can't stand up to winds 20 mph. What I'm looking for is a strong auto open/close, and can stand up to heavy rains. This umbrella is very good quality, with a strong open/close button. I will update when needed, as of now I'm very happy with my purchase. Update: 6/11/18. I've used this a few times now, and the inside is starting to rust. I have never had an umbrella do this."
Decent umbrella compromised by poor-quality rivets,3,YES,3," October 15, 2017",Edward Ripley-Duggan,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE44KV7LF7PV5VJBZJBI4ESLX6RQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R1L9TUARABEK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"The umbrella appears to be robust; I used it recently during rain and gusty winds in New York with no problems. However, though the ribs seem largely rustproof, I am disappointed to see visible rusting at a couple of the rivets where sections of the ribs are joined, in one case offsetting to the fabric of the umbrella. It makes no sense to me to construct a good frame from rust-resistant materials only to sacrifice that quality with cheap rivets. I‰Ûªm disappointed, though I‰Ûªll keep this."
it is still like new. Great construction,4,YES,On," August 14, 2016",MC Oddslice,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZ4KFB33KCAV62LEQCN4HR2ZHMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R2W29XIMWT45JI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"Update: Too small! If there is wind, you will get wet. It kept my head and upper torso dry when I angled it toward the wind. After several months of use, it is still like new. Great construction. The automatic open and close still works, but if there is wind this is a child's umbrella, and you'd be better off with a rain coat, poncho, or bigger umbrella.I did NOT receive a discount for my opinion. This review is based on my initial impressions after receiving the product and nothing more.Packaging: Inside the shipping box, the umbrella did not come in a box of it's own. It was in a plastic sheathe that was slightly too short to encase the handle. The handle was protected by bubble wrap with a rubber band to hold it securely in place.Build: It was exactly as pictured. I expected the handle to be softer, like a gel, but it is a hard plastic with a rubber like surface for improved grip. The build looks sturdy, though I am a little concerned that bottom rod and top rods have a little bit of rotational wiggle. Also, there were some spare loose threads on the end of one of the spokes where it had been tied off. I expected to be able to feel some type of coating, but the fabric feels really thin, and I couldn't see or feel any difference.Functionality: BEWARE! When you first receive it the button may have been pressed already. I unwrapped the strap, and the umbrella sprang out immediately! Be sure you don't have it aimed at anyone, yourself included! I pressed the button, and it sprang closed. It did take some strength to push it back in. It may be difficult for children and some adults. The average person won't have a problem with it. I closed it and opened it 4 or 5 times. It performed consistently and flawlessly.Final Thoughts: It seems to be sturdy, and it opens and closes as it should. For $50.00 I'd like to have seen a gel handle on it, but it was on sale for $20.95, and didn't advertise a gel handle, so I can't take any points away for not being as advertised. We don't get much wind here in Missouri, but the price was right for having a lifetime warranty. I will update this rating after I've tried it in the rain, and or if the open/close mechanism fails."
For a tiny person,2,YES,On," May 25, 2018",AR,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEQZPPY7UKBOX5GVDTMD7SVDZ2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R3FPDTX7M8E0GN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I was excited to try out this umbrella based on its many reviews. However, once I received it, I was not impressed. The shaft of the umbrella was not very long so that meant that if I held this umbrella normally there would not be a lot of space between the top of my head and the top of this umbrella. And who wants to hold an umbrella super close like you're hugging it?Also, the width of the canopy was not great at all. It just barely covered most of my shoulders. Had I used this in actual rain, I'm pretty sure my shoulders and arms and back would've been soaked from lack of coverage.The construction of the umbrella distracted me from examining the quality of the material used. But I will say it didn't strike me as being heavy duty or anything.As I previously stated, overall I wasn't impressed with this product. I have returned it for a refund and a different product by a different brand and seller."
"Decent, a bit pricey?",4,YES,2," September 2, 2017",Alex Wang,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEC3CNVO7ZBAIEKAECQEBAFF65ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R12Q4AXRJF7N6N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"This umbrella is pretty good. never had a umbrella with fiberglass before so it felt like plastic to me (if thats how fiberglass is suppose to feel like then cool). I cant say how good this works with high winds cause i haven't had any, but so far it feels sturdy. The only thing i do not like is the opening and closing mechanism. Mine does not open 100% after pressing the button 100% of the time. The times it doesn't it opens more like 90-95%. And it is a bit expensive at 22 a pop"
Not consistent with reviews or description.,2,YES,3," June 20, 2017",Hannah,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6Y3MTHO6FTKR4OWPE4ZIPZ7VQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R1UX1K6T3MVQHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I must have received a bad item or something because it's nothing like what the reviews or description made it out to be. Two stars only for the functioning open and close button and it holds up fairly well against the wind. Other than that, it's really wobbly, not water repellant at all, broke after about five uses. I am so disappointed in paying so much for an umbrella that pretty much doesn't live up to the description when I could have paid half for one that would last me longer. The ribs are starting to come undone from the string that attaches it to the umbrella. Wonder how long before al the other ribs start doing the same. I would be really weary about purchasing."
Seems well-built and well-designed.,5,YES,0," January 26, 2018",Terende,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIGN5OCJWCHBERPA242XEN4CNLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R3C9IS6HCDZ2EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I bought two of these for my and my spouse's upcoming trip to the UK, where we'll most likely need something reliable and sturdy.  It's heavier, at close to a pound, than most cheaper compact umbrellas, but if that means it's built better (and it looks solid) it's worth it.  Pressing the open/close button causes it to spring open like a Batman utensil, so you'd better be clear of obstructions and/or fragile humans.  Pressing the button again causes the canopy to rapidly collapse, although it doesn't retract down the shaft back to the handle.  You have to push down from the top center of the canopy, where there is a hard disk for that purpose, until it clicks into place.  The pleats retain their shape so that you can easily re-store the umbrella back into the carrying sleeve looking like it did when first opened.  I won't know how it will hold up until we start our vacation, but will post an update if there are any problems."
Good Quality but Nearly Useless - Umbrella for Little People - Like Walking with a Daiquiri Garnish,2,YES,0," July 3, 2018",Robert S. Blackie,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMOO4NZ3Y6L4Z5V4X64JEVSYQ6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R9Y91FN67RVAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I cannot argue with the fact that this umbrella is of superb quality (which is the reason for my giving it 2 stars instead of 1), but the size is so small as to render it nearly useless for anyone over 5' tall (I am 5'10"" - hardly a giant). I had the opportunity to try out my new umbrella today in a steady rain with no wind, and after a 15 minute walk home I was wet from the chest down and my very small backpack was drenched. It's like walking with a strawberry daiquiri garnish, but at least those umbrellas come with a delicious alcoholic beverage. I had to walk intentionally slow just to keep the top third of my body dry. If I didn't live in Mexico I would return it, but from here it just wouldn't be worth the hassle. Now I see why the product listing doesn't indicate the size of the arc - just the length and weight. I'll give this to my 4'11"" sister when she comes to visit this month and buy another, larger one with the arc width clearly indicated. EXTREMELY disappointed."
... have to say this one is by far my favorite. It keeps me dry and has never inverted ...,5,YES,0," February 27, 2018",IJ,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLRVQAOTHJCIDW2IGLPEQ73FM2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R3TDZY6UUOCQM1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I've owned at least 50 umbrellas (some bought off the street from a vendor or designer ones) in my lifetime and have to say this one is by far my favorite. It keeps me dry and has never inverted due to the wind (pet peeve). Want to know something else about this umbrella? The company that sells it is amazing with its customer service and lifetime warranty policy. The button started to not work as well (sometimes have to press it 2-3 times before it reacts) so I reached out to the company. Not only did they respond in record lightening speed time, the company sent out a replacement. This all happened in 12 hours!? Highly recommend this umbrella. I rarely give out 5 stars for anything but have to say between the quality of the umbrella and the customer service/lifetime guarantee, you can't go wrong."

(if it broke within a  year i might try this, with screen shot and video record)cons: -i thought the fabric would be a lot thicker since its teflon coated, not an issue though :) -the spring when opening is not super strong but its my preference only, i like it to be more stronger faster opennote: the cons is base on my preference because i have benkii before and as of  now my bag is small so I chose the top umbrella which i think this is :D kudos to the repel team!"

After a not-so-great impression, I sent a message to the seller who promptly asked if I wanted a refund or replacement.  Needing an umbrella I asked for a replacement.  It arrived quickly and at no cost.  One of my original issues was that the button to open requires far too much effort, so does closing it.  This is still true, but I've come to realize the product (including this part) is well made.My first time using it was during a rainstorm with 50 mph gusts.  I walked 3 blocks from my work to a parking garage.  The umbrella inverted twice.  After that it did not open automatically (popped up but required manual pushing to lock in place.  I am grateful for the free replacement."
This one goes to 9...,5,YES,On," January 29, 2017",Mergatroid,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJVYV2OZXWPG2VBJBIF27AOKZ6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R1C6RZPQ5AB9SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"Nicely built. The metal shaft is black however, not chrome. Ribs have composite plastic components as well as metal. Easy to hold grip. Powerful spring to fully open and partially close. A little smaller profile in ""diameter"" and height than I expected when I first opened it, but it makes it easy to negotiate into and out of a vehicle with the smaller canopy during a downpour (disclaimer: downpour in Southern California). Overall, this is a quality built, lightweight umbrella. Comes with easy on / easy off cover. My last umbrella was nearly 30 years old, and I'm guessing I paid $10 or $12 for it, so the Repel at $24 seems like a good value. I always open mine indoors and let it dry before stowing, so we'll see how it lasts."

Excellent umbrella- would definitely recommend,5,YES,0," October 18, 2017",G Tan,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYALOHBRY5B6QN2E2LCZYHSGJQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R38B28WXFVZAY7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"I like bullet points, thus: + Excellent build construction - does not feel flimsy or cheap. Has held up well against strong winds/downpours. + The small form factor is convenient and makes it easy to carry around. + The quick open/close function helps keep you dry (especially when attempting to enter a vehicle). + Lifetime guarantee is reassuring. That having been said, I can't speak upon their customer service because my umbrella hasn't had any issues. - Mildly more expensiveI believe this umbrella represents a great value. Great construction and I really like the quick open/close feature. It's a touch more expensive, but the build quality and lifetime guarantee easily justify it for me.My only complaint is that I wish it was bigger/ I had gotten a bigger version (which would kind of defeat its compact form factor). This umbrella works very well for an individual, but it is a bit difficult to keep two people dry if it is raining very hard.All in all, an amazing umbrella that I would definitely recommend."

Umbrella has a lot of good features: appears very sturdy with prongs very reinforced with easy arrow triggers to put umbrella up and retract. However, to get it back to original full down position (pulling it toward the handle), I needed two hands to get it down. Due to the strong nature of perhaps those prongs, it is a bit heavy in weight than other umbrellas this size. The sure grip handle is nice, especially when wet. Hoping not to leave this one anywhere (why I bought the compact size to throw in my purse and not on floor)."

Has potential - top piece unreliable,4,YES,On," June 19, 2017",Kevin Lee,https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKFI6EAHKFWMILR2MVWOAH2OZ4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,https://amazon.com//gp/customer-reviews/R111SPOWC9T6P1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160HYB8S,"**Update: I'm updating my review from 2 to 4 stars as the company was insanely fast with reaching out to me and getting me a replacement umbrella. I've used the new one twice and so far so good - as I mentioned before, the construction is sturdy but only time will tell if it stays that way. However, would recommend buying this umbrella based on their customer service alone.The ONE time I got to use the umbrella I could tell that the canopy and spokes were pretty sturdy. However, as a couple of other reviews have mentioned, the top piece is either very loose or not constructed well. The second time I went to grab it, I noticed the top piece had disappeared and was nowhere to be found. This causes rain to get into the umbrella...which sort of defeats the whole purpose of having an umbrella. I've owned at least 15 different umbrellas in my life and not one (yes, not even the $5 umbrellas you get from the guys selling on the street when it's raining) has lost the top piece. In fact, I didn't even know it was a removable piece until I found it missing on this one. If the top piece was constructed better, this umbrella would be worth a much higher rating."

When I saw this on sale and read the reviews, I decided to treat myself to one.  So far I'm impressed.  It feels very durable.  It is beautifully and thoughtfully designed.  For example, the handle has a nice texture that makes it easy to grip.  And the handle is not round, it's oval, so it fits very comfortably in my hand.  I prefer it's fabric wrist strap to the plastic straps on my old umbrellas.  Time will tell how well it holds up with use during winter and spring rains, which I hope are forthcoming!

Interestingly, there is no catch to keep it open once it is deployed, but the springs have sufficient tension to keep it open. If I encounter a windy day strong enough to collapse it, then I will not be happy. As Repel states that I now have a ""lifetime"" warranty, I am not concerned about quality. Assuming, of course, Repel is even still in business once this thing wears out.  Since I live where rain is not very common, it will take years for me to wear it out. For now, I am happy!"

So instead of a nice uninterrupted dome shape, there are a few areas on the umbrella where a rib goes limp and the fabric sags unattractively - and sometimes spills rainwater unexpectedly.I don't know that I would recommend this item.

The auto open/close is quick and easy, the waterproofed fabric leaves very little to shake off.  The size is typical for small umbrellas, so you're dealing with the pro-con of carrying a nice, small collapsible vs. a huge, long (with extra-wide coverage) umbrella.  All in all, I'm quite happy.The closing function collapses the open umbrella; you still need to push the stem together to lock it closed / reload for auto opening.  The spring is quite stiff -- making opening very quick, but also requiring a bit of effort to close / reset.  No complaints! ...but the stiff spring makes me wonder about the longevity: how long will it last.  For the great price, though, if it lasts a year it's been a good purchase."

After debating for a bit if that was a wind management feature or not, looked more closely and seemed like when it was last closed in factory, the two rib joints may have come too close and one of the metal strands looped on another and had to be separated.

Press the button to collapse, one shake, and the entire thing was 99% dry. By the time I got from the front doors of my building to my office, it was entirely dry. I could close it up and stash it away without worry. Co-workers thought it had stopped raining. Going back to my car, I didn't have to worry about excess water being absorbed and getting that lovely mildew smell.I'd definitely recommend buying this one umbrella, as opposed to what I used to do and buy the cheapo $5-10 ones that break after a light gust."

However, the features of having ""Dupont Teflon technology"", ""9 reinforced fiberglass ribs"", and ""Auto open/close"" made me reconsider.When my package had arrived, I needed to test this umbrella.

Outside, it was raining...no... it was pouring cats and dogs.  I had the biggest grin on my face, and I stood up straight and proudly push the button.

I have never had an umbrella with an auto close feature, and was skeptical about its utility, but I have found that this feature comes in handy when you are carrying packages and arrive at your car with only one hand free.

I contacted Amazon for an exchange however at the time I couldn't proceed with an even exchange because the item was slightly higher priced on their site. Luckily I found the card that came with the umbrella and contacted them directly. (I hadn't realized that i should have called them instead of Amazon).

After it ""auto closes"", you still need to get it to compress into the handle. This also requires a lot of strength to push both ends towards each other - and I'm not a weak person.

Didn't wobble at all when a nice wind hit, as cheaper umbrellas would do. By the time I reached the subway platform, my umbrella dried off faster than my North Face boots, a huge plus for me.Only thing about this umbrella is that it's a bit on the narrow side so, as a stocky guy, my left elbow got wet. The measurements were very clear in the product description so it's my fault there. I don't mind the smaller size though - helps to not have a giant umbrella when walking through NYC.I would highly recommend this product but be wearing if you're a bit taller or wider."

I also chose it because it was not expensive. When I first opened the umbrella I thought that I had opened it incorrectly because it seemed short, then I realized that it was just made that way. A week or two later it was windy and drizzling, so I used the umbrella. The umbrella fought most gusts of wind, but one particularly strong one did flip it inside out. The umbrella did not break, and I was able to flip it back. I find the instant open and close button amusing but I have to be careful not to accidentally press it because it is a bit sensitive and not that difficult to accidentally trigger.

My wife and I have been sharing an umbrella by a company called Rainbrella. No idea where the umbrella came from, but it's great. It has a slightly bigger handle than the Repel Umbrella, and it has grooves in the handle to hold it better (I love this feature). I decided it's probably time to get my own umbrella, so I bought this based off of reviews. I am comparing the Repel with the Rainbrella, which is our favorite. Our old umbrella also has a longer height when extended (about 1.5-2 inches longer than the Repel). Width is not that big of a difference to really bother me, although the Repel is a tad smaller. I was a little disappointed that the height is shorter on the Repel but perhaps this is a good thing. The Repel folded up is a little shorter than the other one so it will fit in my bag better. I needed something small and unobtrusive to carry to work. I live in Chicago and I'm starting a job pretty close to the lake, so I wanted something pretty wind resistant. I was a little skeptical of the Repel because it seemed too good to be true and I have never heard of this company, but with 77% of people liking the product, I decided to give it a shot. It's a little pricey, but not much more than a Totes umbrella I bought a while back that was about $20.I will update when I actually test it."

It has quite the excited opening mechanism, so hold on to it until you know what to expect.  The auto collapse feature is perfect for me while I'm trying to get into my car while it's raining.The ties all feel and look strong; of course the test of time will tell if it's perfect, but so far it appears much better made than the cheaper ones I find at gas stations and big box stores.  It was shorter and fatter than my last umbrella, and I like the dimensions here better than my last one.  This is easier to shove into a big pocket or to fit into a bag or I presume a purse.The rubberized grip and button feel very sturdy and solid, and so far the button requires enough of a press that I've never accidentally collapsed it when I haven't intended on it.  So far, under very heavy rain, it's been perfectly waterproof.  I know that should be a given, but you might be amazed at how many cheap umbrellas I've gotten and returned because somehow a spot or two would leak."

So in the hopes that this will stop them from annoying me every couple of weeks, I'm leaving a review of 3 stars because that is the middle range.  I have no real idea how good this umbrella is until I actually use the thing, but these folks want a review pronto, so I'll go along and give a lower review than if I had waited and loved it and would have given it a 5 star review, or maybe a higher review if I used it and hated it and would have given it a one star review. I opened the umbrella and it opened well, closing it was a little harder as you have to push the umbrella together and down to actually get it back to size to fit in it's case.  Getting it in the case was the hardest of all-the umbrella and I tangled a bit, and it did seem as though the umbrella was winning, but I finally triumphed and was able to stuff the thing back in it's case.  This is all i know so far.  When and if it rains in SoCAl, hopefully I'll know more."

So if pointing this into the wind and rain the effective length of the shaft will become somewhat shorter.  Also, to clarify closing, when you press the close button there is a hard snap sound and the umbrella violently closes the canopy.  At this point, per the instructions, you now have to place one palm on top of the closed wet umbrella with the other palm on the base of the handle, and push it together.  I have tried pulling it down from the inside but this requires quite a bit of force, as others have mentioned.  The canopy is 37"" wide when open, not 42"".  Hope this helps.Edit (Aug. 16th, 2017):  There is no way to reopen the umbrella after pressing the close button.  The open button does not work at this point and even attempting to reopen the canopy does not work.  You Must fully close it with both hands into the closed and Locked position before you can reopen.  Also, some rain comes through the area where the canopy is sewn to the arms.  I have down-graded my star rating to 3 Stars."

The button to activate the umbrella is hard to push, and harder still is getting the umbrella back into its original position. It requires a lot of jamming and jerking, eventually warping the bar, making it useless. That's fine and I expect to buy umbrellas often since I moved to a windier climate. What bothers me more is feeling pressured to leave a review by the company by constant emails. When they read my original review, they offered a refund or replacement, which is very sweet, but at this point, I just want to be left alone.If you use an umbrella once every so often, it's decent for the price. Maybe I got a defective button or catch. I don't know. I'm sick of Amazon's companies constant emails to ""check in"" after they already have my money."

This button works great.My personal issue is that if I bother with an umbrella at all, it is because I am going to meetings carrying things I do not want to get wet.Heavy files, models, rolls of drawings...When returning to a vehicle with arms loaded, closing an umbrella in the rain while putting items in the car and escaping the rain is tricky.Though I can push the button to collapse the tines, actually pushing the umbrella closed to a locked position requires two hands.Because the umbrella is so sturdy, it is hard to push down while maneuvering into the driver's seat of a car.One must use two hands outside of the car door, getting wet while doing so.I hope to have this umbrella for a while, and I am sure it will serve well during normal use.But I will look for another umbrella which totally collapses more easily to use when I go to meetings in the rain."

The umbrella is light and durable but does not last long.November 2016Light and durable. And only takes a couple minutes to set the umbrella.

I was glad that they contacted me to see if I was happy with this umbrella and took it upon themselves to initiate a replacement process when I mentioned a problem with it. I will definitely be buying from them again in the future.The Umbrella itself is a good solid product which looks like it should last a lot longer than the cheapy umbrellas I tend to go through a few times a year. I really like its auto-open/close feature although I wish the button were a little less sensitive. Reasonably small and light enough for travel but big enough to cover one person very well or two people moderately well.
